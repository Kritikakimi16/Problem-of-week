# Problem-of-week
This repository is part of an initiative started at GLA University, guided by Mohd Amir Sir, with the goal of helping students build consistency and confidence in coding through regular weekly practice.

As a B.Tech CSE student, I’ve realized that the biggest challenge in coding is not complexity — it’s consistency. We attend lectures, do assignments, and occasionally solve problems, but we often fail to maintain a rhythm. That’s where the idea of “Problem of the Week” comes in.

Every week, one or two handpicked coding problems will be uploaded here. These problems focus on core concepts like arrays, strings, recursion, searching, sorting, and data structures. For each problem, I’ll try to implement multiple approaches — from brute-force to optimized — to understand not just the “how” but the “why” behind each method.
